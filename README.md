# Particle Flow Visualization ✨

An interactive 2D particle flow visualization project using p5.js. 🎨🖌️

## Description

I'm learning p5.js driven by curiosity. This is a project to explore and understand the library by creating a 2D particle flow visualization. It combines various effects such as noise-based movement, color transitions, fireworks, and interactive mouse effects like swirling and attracting to create a dynamic and engaging visual experience. 🌟🔮

Check out the [the repository page](https://hecrp.github.io/2D-Particles/) to navigate the current implementation.

## Features

- Dynamic particle system with customizable parameters 🔧
- Multiple color palettes and blending modes 🎨
- Firework effects with various trajectories and behaviors 🎆
- Zoom functionality for exploring the particle field 🔍
- Interactive mouse effects (attract, repel, swirl, vortex, wave) 🖱️
- Customizable particle shapes 🔶🔷
- Adjustable noise functions for particle movement 🌊

## Installation

Static mode:

You can run the current project by cloning the repository and opening the src/index.html file in the browser. 

Basic server mode (for future implementation of new visualizations and deployment):

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/particle-flow-visualization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd particle-flow-visualization
   ```
3. Install dependencies (express and socket.io):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage (server mode)

1. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment). 


## Configuration

The project includes a GUI for real-time adjustment of various parameters: 

- Particle settings (count, size, lifespan, etc.) 🔢
- Color settings (palette, speed, blend mode, etc.) 🌈
- Firework settings (size, lifespan, effects, etc.) 🎇
- Zoom settings 🔎
- Mouse effect settings 🐁

Explore these settings to create unique visual experiences. 🎉🌠
